\section{About Me}

	\entry
	{}
	{Computer Enthusiast}
	{First Generation College Student}
	{
		I always have had a fascination with computing. Whether it be creating small websites at a young age to building fully featured applications now, I have always had a passion for development!  My love for computing doesn't just stop at the software level either.  As a hobby, I also build computers, host servers, and much more.  Computing, to me, is less a career and more a way of life.
