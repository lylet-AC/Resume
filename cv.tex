\section{About Me}
\begin{entrylist}
	\entry
	{}
	{Computer Enthusiast}
	{First Generation College Student}
	{Ever since I was young, I was fascinated with computers. As a low income family, my father could not afford a new computer to support this interest.  Therefore, my first computer was a laptop constructed from other recycled and broken laptops.  Given our low income status, I could also not afford to purchase a Windows XP license. As such, I spent most of my time from 8 years old using machines operating various Linux distributions.\\
	
	From here, my father and I spent countless hours learning web development and I.T. together, with my first programming language being JavaScript.  Even after he decided to exit the field in 2017, my love for computers did not dwindle.  I am currently graduating Allegheny College in 2019 with a degree in Computer Science, and a concentration in Software Development.  To me, the field of C.S. is not just a career, it is a passion.
